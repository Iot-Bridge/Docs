# Lora Channel Service

Our 'Lora Channel Service' is intended to handle callbacks from The Things Stack V3, or any system 
that is compatible with the same network protocol.

We recommend to use our Lora deep integration to configure devices that connect to the The Things Stack.
This allows our platform to configure itself and the device with a single click of a button.

Check out [Credentials - Things Stack](accounts-and-subscriptions/adding-things-stack-credentials.md) on how to link IotBridge to your Things Stack V3 account.

If you have already linked IotBridge to your Things Stack V3 account, check out [how to add a device](devices/adding.md) using your Things Stack V3 credentials.
