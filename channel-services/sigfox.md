# Sigfox Channel Service

Our 'Sigfox Channel Service' is intended to handle callbacks from The Sigfox Backend.

We recommend to use our Sigfox deep integration to configure devices that communicate via Sigfox.
This allows our platform to configure itself and the device with a single click of a button.

Check out [Credentials - Sigfox](accounts-and-subscriptions/adding-sigfox-credentials.md) on how to link IotBridge to your Sigfox account.

If you have already linked IotBridge to your Sigfox account, check out [how to add a device](devices/adding.md) using your Sigfox credentials.
