# Subscriptions

A subscription is a group for resources (devices, device types, places, Magix profiles...) that will be billed together. Resources cannot be shared between subscriptions. 

Subscriptions can be found by navigating to the Manage Account page. Select the 'Manage Account' button on the account dropdown which can be found by clicking your name on the top right.
